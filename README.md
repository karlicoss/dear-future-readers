# Dear future readers

On February 2, 2020, a carbon copy of every public repository on GitHub will be captured and preserved in a decommissioned coal mine in the Svalbard archipelago, closer to the North Pole than the Arctic Circle. While most repositories on GitHub are set up for code versioning, this one is meant as a message to those who eventually recover it from the permafrost.
