# Dear future readers

On February 2, 2020, a carbon copy of every public repository on GitHub [will be captured and preserved](https://archiveprogram.github.com) in a decommissioned coal mine in the Svalbard archipelago, closer to the North Pole than the Arctic Circle. While most repositories on GitHub are set up for code versioning, this one is meant as a message to those who eventually recover it from the permafrost.

## Notes

If someone is reading this, a better starting point to understand who I was and what I was doing would be [my blog](https://beepb00p.xyz), which will be archived as [karlicoss.github.io](https://github.com/karlicoss/karlicoss.github.io). 
E.g. ['me'](https://github.com/karlicoss/karlicoss.github.io/blob/master/me.html) page and the social networks listed there would be a good start.

To be honest, I really hope this archive will never fulfil its purpose. I'm quite optimistic about the future of humanity and believe we will fix everything and be all right.

In the bad scenario, I believe there will be orders of magnitudes more conscious entities at some point in the future, than it is now, so every bit of history will be helpful and interesting to some of them.

## How to use

Feel free to use this repository as a starting point / inspiration for your own dormant time capsule.
